# maze-solver-algorithm
A maze solver (AI) that accepts a maze encoded in a text file and finds the solution using either Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms. The text file that represents the maze must contain the following convention:
- "#" to represent a block
- "A" to represent the starting point
- "B" to represent the ending point or goal.

Instances of such a maze are available in the repository in maze1.txt, maze2.txt, and maze3.txt.

## Requirements and how to use
A Python interpreter is required to run the algorithm. In order to execute it with the maze in maze1.txt, for instance, use the following command (with the desired maze in a .txt file): 
```txt
python maze.py maze1.txt
```
