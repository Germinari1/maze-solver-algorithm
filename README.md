# maze-solver-algorithm
A maze solver (AI) that accepts a maze encoded in a text file and finds the solution using either Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms. The text file that represents the maze must contain the following convention:
- "#" to represent a block
- "A" to represent the starting point
- "B" to represent the ending point or goal.
An instance of such a maze is the following:

#####B#
##### #
####  #
#### ##
     ##
A######
